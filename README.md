#### - Looking at the Goal vs Pledged Box Plot of musical campaigns in Great Britain, we see that half of the campaigns'goals are less than $2000 which is only a little over the third quartile of the pledged amount. 
#### - We also see that the goal box plot is bigger than the pledged box plot which indicates that the standard deviation is more in the goal than the pledged. This means that the data varies a lot more in the goal data compared to the pledged data.
#### - Even the outlier of the pledged box plot is almost equal to the upper limit of the goal box plot. All this indicates that the campaign goals data is very spread out.
#### - So, in order for Louise's future musical campaign to be successful, her goal for her musical campaign should be less than the third quartile of the pledge amount which is $1,496 but definetly higher than the median ($386.50) of the pledged box plot.
