# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
### "An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns."
#### We are making an analysis for Louise whose play 'Fever' reached her campaing goal in a short period of time. She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and fundraising goals. For this purpose, we are using Excel to create two analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch dates.

### Purpose
#### Our analysis can help Louise determine if she made the right choices of when she launched her campaign and for how much she set her campaign goa for her play 'Fever'. It will also help her future campaigns to be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
### 1. From the line graph we infer that the theater campaigns are the most successful during the months of May followed by June. So it would be the best time of the year for Louise to launch her campaign.
### 2.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
